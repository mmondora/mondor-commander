# Security Testing

> **Version**: 1.2.0 | **Last updated**: 2026-02-09

## Purpose

Automated security testing integrated into the development cycle. SAST, DAST, dependency scanning, authorization testing, secret detection, and container/IaC scanning.

---

## SAST (Static Application Security Testing)

Static analysis of source code for known vulnerabilities. Run in CI on every PR.

**TypeScript**: ESLint with security plugin (`eslint-plugin-security`), Semgrep with TypeScript/Node.js rules. **Swift**: SwiftLint with custom security rules.

Rules: block PR on CRITICAL/HIGH findings. WARNING as a comment in PR review.

---

## DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing)

Testing the running application for runtime vulnerabilities. OWASP ZAP as automated scanner in staging.

Workflow: deploy to staging -> run ZAP baseline scan -> report -> fix before production. Cadence: on every release candidate. Full active scan weekly.

### ZAP Baseline Scan Configuration

```yaml
# .github/workflows/dast.yml
- name: OWASP ZAP Baseline Scan
  uses: zaproxy/action-baseline@v0.10
  with:
    target: 'https://staging.example.com'
    rules_file_name: 'zap-rules.tsv'
    cmd_options: '-a -j'  # AJAX spider, JSON report

# zap-rules.tsv — customize alert thresholds
# Rule ID  Action  Description
10010      WARN    Cookie No HttpOnly Flag
10011      WARN    Cookie Without Secure Flag
10015      FAIL    Incomplete or No Cache-control Header
10020      FAIL    X-Frame-Options Header Not Set
10021      FAIL    X-Content-Type-Options Header Missing
10038      FAIL    Content Security Policy Header Not Set
40012      FAIL    Cross Site Scripting (Reflected)
40014      FAIL    Cross Site Scripting (Persistent)
90011      FAIL    Charset Mismatch
```

---

## Dependency Scanning

`npm audit` in CI (block on critical). Renovate/Dependabot for automatic updates. Socket.dev or Snyk for advanced supply chain analysis (typosquatting, malicious code injection). For Swift: `swift package audit` (if available) or Snyk.

---

## Container Image Scanning

Scan container images for known vulnerabilities before pushing to registry.

**Tools**: Trivy or Grype in CI pipeline.

**Policy**: block on CRITICAL vulnerabilities. HIGH vulnerabilities require exception or fix within 1 sprint.

```yaml
# In GitHub Actions
- name: Scan container image
  uses: aquasecurity/trivy-action@master
  with:
    image-ref: '${{ env.IMAGE }}'
    severity: 'CRITICAL,HIGH'
    exit-code: '1'
```

---

## IaC Scanning

Scan Terraform/Kubernetes configuration for security misconfigurations.

**Tools**: Checkov, tfsec, or Trivy (supports IaC scanning).

**Checks**: overly permissive IAM roles, public storage buckets, unencrypted databases, missing network policies, hardcoded credentials in IaC.

---

## Authorization Testing

Automated tests verifying tenant isolation and role-based access. These are the most important security tests in a multi-tenant application.

```typescript
describe('Tenant isolation', () => {
  it('prevents access to another tenant resources', async () => {
    const res = await request(app)
      .get('/api/v1/tenants/t_other/invoices')
      .set('Authorization', `Bearer ${tokenForTenantA}`);
    expect(res.status).toBe(403);
  });
  it('prevents viewer from creating invoices', async () => {
    const res = await request(app)
      .post('/api/v1/tenants/t_test/invoices')
      .set('Authorization', `Bearer ${viewerToken}`)
      .send(validInvoiceData);
    expect(res.status).toBe(403);
  });
});
```

Generate a test for every combination (role × action × resource) — tedious but essential. Use matrix testing or parameterized tests.

### API Security Testing

Test for common API vulnerabilities beyond tenant isolation:

```typescript
describe('API Security', () => {
  it('prevents IDOR — cannot access invoice by guessing ID', async () => {
    const otherInvoice = await createInvoiceForTenant('t_other');
    const res = await request(app)
      .get(`/api/v1/tenants/t_test/invoices/${otherInvoice.id}`)
      .set('Authorization', `Bearer ${tokenForTenantA}`);
    expect(res.status).toBe(404); // Not 403 — don't reveal existence
  });

  it('prevents mass assignment — ignores unpermitted fields', async () => {
    const res = await request(app)
      .post('/api/v1/tenants/t_test/invoices')
      .set('Authorization', `Bearer ${editorToken}`)
      .send({ ...validInvoice, role: 'admin', tenantId: 't_other' }); // attempt to escalate
    expect(res.body.role).toBeUndefined();
    expect(res.body.tenantId).toBe('t_test'); // Server-enforced, not from request
  });

  it('handles fuzzing — rejects malformed input gracefully', async () => {
    const fuzzInputs = [null, '', 0, [], {}, '<script>alert(1)</script>', 'a'.repeat(100000)];
    for (const input of fuzzInputs) {
      const res = await request(app)
        .post('/api/v1/tenants/t_test/invoices')
        .set('Authorization', `Bearer ${editorToken}`)
        .send({ amount: input });
      expect(res.status).toBeGreaterThanOrEqual(400);
      expect(res.status).toBeLessThan(500); // Client error, not server crash
    }
  });
});
```

### Authenticated DAST

Run DAST scans with authentication to test beyond the login page:

```yaml
# ZAP with authentication context
- name: OWASP ZAP Authenticated Scan
  uses: zaproxy/action-full-scan@v0.10
  with:
    target: 'https://staging.example.com'
    cmd_options: '-z "-config auth.method=2 -config auth.bearer=${{ secrets.STAGING_TOKEN }}"'
```

### False Positive Triage

Security scan false positives erode trust. Process:

1. Review finding — is it a real vulnerability or a false positive?
2. If false positive: add inline suppression with justification comment
3. Track suppression count — rising count may indicate misconfigured rules
4. Review suppressions quarterly — conditions may have changed

---

## Secret Detection

Pre-commit hook (git-secrets, gitleaks) blocking commits containing secret patterns (AWS keys, GCP service account JSON, plaintext passwords). CI scan as backup.

**Patterns to detect**: AWS access keys (`AKIA...`), GCP service account JSON (`"type": "service_account"`), generic passwords (`password\s*=`), private keys (`-----BEGIN.*PRIVATE KEY-----`), API tokens.

---

## Severity Policy & Gating

### Default Severity Policy

| Severity | Action | Timeline |
|----------|--------|----------|
| Critical | **BLOCK** — cannot merge/deploy | Fix immediately |
| High | **BLOCK** unless exception approved | Fix within 1 sprint |
| Medium | **WARN** + backlog ticket created | Fix within 2 sprints |
| Low | Informational | Address opportunistically |

### Exception Process

When a High finding cannot be immediately resolved, document an exception:

```markdown
## Security Exception

**Finding**: [CVE/CWE ID] — [brief description]
**Component**: [package/file affected]
**Justification**: [why it cannot be fixed now]
**Compensating controls**: [what mitigates the risk]
  - e.g., "Not reachable from user input", "WAF rule blocks exploit path"
**Expiry date**: [YYYY-MM-DD — max 90 days]
**Owner**: [person responsible for resolution]
**Ticket**: [link to tracking ticket]
```

Exceptions are reviewed monthly. Expired exceptions become blockers.

## For Claude Code

When generating security tests: tenant isolation test for every multi-tenant endpoint, role-based access test for every protected endpoint, include ESLint security plugin in configuration. Don't forget negative tests (access denied = correct behavior). Include container and IaC scanning in CI pipelines. When a security finding is reported, suggest fix with severity and timeline.
