# Skill Clusters

> **Version**: 1.2.0 | **Last updated**: 2026-02-13

## Purpose

Central index of skill clusters for bulk loading. When a user requests skills by cluster or domain name, consult this file to identify which skills to load together. Supports English and Italian aliases.

## Aliases

Use these aliases to match user requests to clusters:

| Alias (EN) | Alias (IT) | Cluster |
|------------|------------|---------|
| foundations, governance, principles | fondamenta, governance, principi | `foundations` |
| cloud, infrastructure, infra, terraform | cloud, infrastruttura, terraform | `cloud-infrastructure` |
| security, compliance, auth, owasp | sicurezza, compliance, autenticazione | `security-compliance` |
| testing, quality, tests, property-based | test, qualita, testing | `testing-quality` |
| delivery, release, deploy, CI/CD, chaos | rilascio, deploy, pipeline | `delivery-release` |
| docs, documentation, diagrams | documentazione, diagrammi | `documentation-diagrams` |
| data, database, events, caching, optimizer | dati, database, eventi, cache | `data-architecture` |
| api, architecture, microservices, legacy | api, architettura, microservizi | `architecture-patterns` |
| ai, rag, vector, embeddings | ai, rag, vettori, embeddings | `ai-applications` |

## For Claude Code

When a user requests a cluster (e.g., "load the security skills", "fammi la foundations", "carica testing & quality"):

1. Match the request to a cluster using the alias table above
2. Read all skills listed under that cluster
3. Apply the combined knowledge when generating output
4. If the request is ambiguous, list matching clusters and ask for clarification

When a user says "load all skills" or "carica tutto", load all 9 clusters sequentially by priority: foundations → security-compliance → testing-quality → delivery-release → cloud-infrastructure → data-architecture → architecture-patterns → ai-applications → documentation-diagrams.

---

## Anti-Patterns

- Loading all clusters when only one is needed — increases context without benefit
- Ignoring the cluster field in skill frontmatter — use it for filtering and grouping
- Hardcoding cluster membership — always read from skill frontmatter as source of truth
